# ClauseCode AI - Pitch Deck Narration Script

## Slide 1: Title/Team Slide
**[Duration: 35 seconds]**

"Hey everyone! We're ClauseCode AI - Clare, Clare, and Adeline from Nardin Academy. We're here to solve a problem that literally everyone has but nobody talks about. Have you ever actually read the Terms and Conditions before clicking 'Accept'? Yeah, we didn't think so. According to a 2017 Deloitte survey, 91% of consumers don't read them, and for our age group it's 97%. We're high school students who built an AI to read all the legal stuff so you don't have to. Let's dive in."

## Slide 2: The Problem
**[Duration: 50 seconds]**

"So here's what we're dealing with: First, nobody actually reads Terms and Conditions. That 91% statistic is real - from Deloitte. For people 18 to 34, it jumps to 97%.

Second, even if you wanted to read them, they're absurdly long. TikTok's terms alone are 11,698 words - that would take over an hour and a half to read. A 2019 Pew Research study found only 9% of adults always read privacy policies. Companies are hiding sketchy clauses in there because they know we're not reading.

And third, if you actually want legal help understanding this stuff? You're looking at hundreds of dollars for a lawyer. A 2024 survey found 39% of people sign contracts without understanding them, often because legal help is just too expensive. As students, we definitely can't afford that."

## Slide 3: The Solution
**[Duration: 50 seconds]**

"That's where ClauseCode AI comes in. We've got four key features that make us different.

First, AI with personality. You can get serious analysis from our Lawyer mode, or switch to brainrot mode when you want it explained like a TikTok video. Your choice.

Second, instant results. We're talking seconds, not days or hours.

Third, actually helpful output. We find the sketchy stuff, summarize everything, and give you real advice on whether you should sign.

And fourth, it works everywhere. Chrome, Safari, web app, mobile - wherever you are.

But here's the best part - our users love it. We tested with 11 students and got 100% saying they liked it, 100% saying it was easy to use, and an average rating of 4.9 out of 5. One student said 'nothing, it's so cool' when asked what to improve. Another loved the brainrot personality because 'everyone's on TikTok so it uses terms all ages can understand.'"

## Slide 4: Demo
**[Duration: 35 seconds]**

"Here's how it works in three simple steps.

Step one: Upload or paste your document. PDFs, Word docs, website links, or just copy-paste text directly into the extension.

Step two: Choose your persona. We have five different AI personalities - from serious lawyer to full brainrot mode.

Step three: Get instant analysis. You'll receive a comprehensive breakdown in seconds - red flags highlighted, plain-English summaries, and clear explanations of what everything actually means.

We have a 30-second demo available if you want to see it in action analyzing a real Terms and Conditions document."

## Slide 5: Product Features
**[Duration: 35 seconds]**

"Let's talk about what goes in and what comes out.

On the input side, we handle legal documents - PDFs, Word files, text files. We take website URLs for Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policies. You can paste text from any source. And you select which AI persona you want.

For outputs, you get a plain-English summary of the whole document. Red flag warnings for any sketchy clauses. Key terms explained in simple language. Recommendations on whether you should actually sign this thing. And you can export the full analysis report to save or share."

## Slide 6: User Testing
**[Duration: 60 seconds]**

"We did extensive testing with real users. We surveyed 11 students from grades 6 through 12, and the results were incredible. 100% liked the extension. 100% found it easy to use. 100% liked the design. Average rating: 4.9 out of 5.

Here's what they said: 'It was easy to understand the terms and conditions.' 'Very easy to understand the language.' And about the brainrot personality - 'it was funny' and 'everyone's on TikTok so it uses terms all ages can understand.' Bob was also a favorite - students loved the emojis and humor.

What did we learn? Personality matters. Making legal docs fun and relatable works. Our 100% usability rate shows the design is intuitive for everyone from 6th to 12th grade. Users actually understood the terms after using our extension - proving our solution works.

But we didn't just do user testing - we also tested for accuracy. We ran TikTok's entire Terms of Service through all five personas. The Lawyer persona scored 9 out of 10 on identifying scary parts. The CEO and Brain Rot personas both got 9 out of 10 on summaries. Bob got 9 out of 10 on pros and cons. After this testing, we refined our AI prompts to improve accuracy across all personas."

## Slide 7: Competitive Landscape
**[Duration: 40 seconds]**

"So how do we stack up against the competition?

Speed: We give results in seconds. Traditional lawyers take days. Other AI tools are fast too, but...

Cost: We're free or $5 to $19 per month. Traditional lawyers cost $200 to $500 or more. Other AI tools run $10 to $50 a month.

Personality: We have 5 unique personas. Traditional lawyers are formal only. Other AI tools are generic and boring.

Accessibility: Anyone can use our tool. Traditional legal is complex. Other AI tools are mainly for tech users.

What makes us different? We're the only ones making legal stuff actually fun and relatable. Research shows 91% of consumers accept terms without reading - we're solving a real problem that everyone has."

## Slide 8: Next Steps
**[Duration: 45 seconds]**

"So what's next for ClauseCode AI?

In the immediate future - zero to three months - we're launching on Chrome Web Store and the App Store. We're aiming for 1,000 users through our school community and social media. We're adding a payment system for the Pro tier subscription. And we're expanding user testing to gather even more feedback.

Three to six months out, we're adding support for more document types like contracts and leases. Developing mobile app improvements based on user feedback. Creating educational partnerships with schools. And building an API for third-party integrations.

Long-term vision? We want to become the go-to tool for understanding any legal document. Partner with educational institutions for digital literacy programs. Expand to serve businesses analyzing vendor contracts. And ultimately, make legal understanding accessible to everyone, everywhere.

Thanks for listening! Any questions?"
