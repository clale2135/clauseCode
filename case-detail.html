                    <h3>What Happened</h3>
                    <p>Cambridge Analytica harvested personal data from millions of Facebook users without their explicit consent through a seemingly innocent personality quiz app. The data was then used for political advertising and voter manipulation during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Brexit referendum.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Problematic Clause</h3>
                    <p>Facebook's terms allowed third-party apps to access not only the data of users who installed the app, but also the data of their friends. The data sharing clause stated:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Apps could collect information about users and their friends</li>
                        <li>Broad permissions for data use by third parties</li>
                        <li>Vague language about how data could be shared and used</li>

                        <strong>💥 Impact</strong>
                        <p>87 million users had their personal information, including likes, locations, and private messages, harvested without meaningful consent. This data was used to create psychological profiles for targeted political advertising. Facebook was fined $5 billion by the FTC.</p>

                    <div class="lesson-learned">
                        <strong>💡 Lesson Learned</strong>
                        <p>Always scrutinize clauses about third-party data sharing and friend data access. If an app can access your friends' data, everyone in your network is at risk. Question why an app needs access to information beyond what's necessary for its core function.</p>

                    <p>Uber's terms of service included a mandatory arbitration clause that prevented users from filing class-action lawsuits. Victims of sexual assault, price fixing, and wage theft were forced into private arbitration, where they couldn't band together or make their cases public.</p>

                        <p>Thousands of sexual assault victims were silenced and forced into private arbitration. Drivers couldn't collectively sue for wage theft. Customers couldn't join together to challenge price fixing. Individual arbitration is expensive and favors the company with deeper pockets.</p>

                        <p>Forced arbitration clauses strip away your right to sue and your ability to join with others. After public pressure, Uber changed its policy for sexual assault cases in 2018, but arbitration clauses remain common. Look for services that don't require you to give up your day in court.</p>

                    <h3>What Happened</h3>
                    <p>Ring (owned by Amazon) established partnerships with over 2,000 police departments, allowing law enforcement to request doorbell camera footage from users. The terms of service gave Ring broad rights to share user video data.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Problematic Clauses</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ring could share video footage with law enforcement without warrants</li>
                        <li>Users weren't always notified when police requested their videos</li>
                        <li>Broad license granted to Ring to use, modify, and share user content</li>
                        <li>Videos could be retained indefinitely</li>

                        <strong>💥 Impact</strong>
                        <p>Police obtained footage of users and their neighbors without warrants. Communities of color were disproportionately surveilled. Ring employees were caught watching customer videos without authorization. The surveillance network created a warrantless mass surveillance system.</p>

                        <p>Smart home devices with cameras create permanent records that can be accessed by companies and law enforcement.

                    <h3>What Happened</h3>
                    <p>Equifax suffered a massive data breach exposing Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses, and credit card numbers of 147 million Americans. Their initial response required victims to waive their right to sue in order to receive free credit monitoring.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Liability waivers that limited Equifax's responsibility for breaches</li>

                        <p>147 million people had their most sensitive personal information exposed, leading to identity theft and fraud. Victims initially had to choose between credit monitoring and their right to sue. The breach resulted from Equifax's failure to patch known security vulnerabilities. Settlement provided only $125-$425 per person.</p>

                        <p>Liability limitation clauses protect companies, not you. Credit bureaus collect your data without your consent, then limit their responsibility when they fail to protect it. Always read what rights you're giving up, especially after a company's failure harms you. Freeze your credit to protect against identity theft.</p>

                    <p>During the pandemic, Zoom's explosive growth revealed problematic privacy practices: an "attention tracking" feature that monitored if users were focused on the Zoom window, sharing data with Facebook without disclosure, and misleading claims about end-to-end encryption.</p>

                        <p>"Free" services often monetize your data and behavior. Features like attention tracking turn communication tools into surveillance systems. Claims about security and encryption should be verified by independent experts, not just taken at face value. Read privacy policies before using video conferencing for sensitive conversations.</p>
